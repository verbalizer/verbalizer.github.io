title : Install Plugin in Protege
---

<p >
	To install the verbalizer Plugin, follow these few steps. Depending on your system and your Protege installation (Protege 5 is recommended) the procedure may vary.
</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>
	Download archive from this <a href="/data/Verbalizer_1.0.1.zip">link</a>, open a terminal and navigate to your download folder.
   	In this terminal, enter
    	<div class="terminal">unzip verbalizerPluginProtege.zip</div>

<p>
   	to extract the archive. Now change into the newly created folder (most likely by typing <code>cd verbalizerplugin</code>) and type:
	<div class="terminal">cp VerbalizationService&ltversion&gt.jar &ltProtege Installation Directory&gt/plugins/</div>
</p>

<p>
	This will copy the jar file to the plugin folder of your Protege installation. (by default your protege diractory is <code>$HOME/Protege&ltVersion&gt</code>).
